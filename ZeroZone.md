# Zero-Zone-Concept

The idea of zone zero was introduced at the same time as the main idea and the concepts of this zone were formed over time.
In the Genesis network, landowners and users sometimes need to talk to each other about big decisions, before that we had a place for each land to talk; But in the land of Genesis (the whole network) we have designed a region called Zero Zone; In this place, all network users can be present to talk about the major issues of the Genesis network and, if necessary, to consider rules for the entire network.
As you can see, Genesis is a decentralized network without the intervention of any government agency run by its users, and if necessary, users can vote for the network by voting and obtaining a majority of votes.
pay attention: for the network not for your land.
According to the MGL-GEN land protocol, you own the land forever, and no law in the network can take away your ownership of your land or the world you built unless you want to sell or transfer your land yourself.
This is so that in the future capitalists will not be able to control the network.
Rules that can be passed in the Genesis network that do not harm the structure and independence of the network and its decentralization.
